# sentimeet
Connecting server-side python and client-side js to create a Google Chrome extension to screenshot and analyze emotions

To note:
  To run the code, you must use your own AWS Security Access IDs (location where to insert shown in app.py).
  Another thing to note is that you can generate your own ngrok link, and replace the current ngrok links in the corresponding place in manifest.json and screenshot.js.
